[Google Professional Certificate Project Management](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/gestion-de-proyectos-de-google) is a certification program offered by Google in collaboration with Coursera. 

The program consists of a series of six courses covering various topics such as project initiation, planning, execution, monitoring and controlling, and closing. 

It takes on average 6 months to complete with a workload of 15 hours per week and is designed for individuals with varying levels of project management experience, including those who are experienced professionals.

Upon completion of the program, individuals receive a certificate that showcases their skills and knowledge in project management, recognized by both employers and peers.

## Project Sauce & Spoon
The last course of a program is a real-world setting project Sauce & Spoon.
During the project I did many hands-on activities, such as:

* Analyzed project documents to identify project needs and assess stakeholders

* Created a project charter and used it as a tool to clarify the scope and objectives of the project to stakeholders

* Identified tasks and milestones (and made them SMART!) and negotiated with stakeholders to prioritize them

* Developed a project plan by reviewing project documents, conducting online research, analyzing key conversations, documenting tasks and milestones.

* Demonstrated effective communication skills to accurately estimate project task time.

* Defined quality standards and evaluated the project against them to ensure quality.

* Derived evaluation questions from survey questions and effectively shared qualitative data.

* Polished strategies for a productive retrospective, including encouraging participation, accountability, and positivity.

* Communicated and escalated project issues to stakeholders and demonstrated the impact through effective reports
