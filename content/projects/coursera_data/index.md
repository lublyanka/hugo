## Data Analysis with R Programming
The most exciting part of the program for me was a course on the R programming language. 
I had wanted to try it for a long time but had my doubts. This course gave me the opportunity to gain firsthand experience with R. 
I learned several key aspects of R, including:

* The R language itself and its programming environment.
* Fundamental concepts such as functions, variables, data types, pipes, and vectors.
* Various methods for creating visualizations in R.
* Basic formatting in R Markdown to structure and highlight content.
