__Intelligent and Adaptive__: Cockatoos are highly intelligent birds known for their problem-solving abilities and adaptability. Similarly, Scrum Management encourages teams to continuously learn, adapt, and overcome challenges, making it a flexible and intelligent project management approach.

__Social and Collaborative__: Cockatoos are social birds that thrive in group settings, and likewise, Scrum Management emphasizes collaboration and effective teamwork. Scrum teams work closely together, fostering open communication and mutual support to achieve shared goals.

__Expressive Communication__: Cockatoos are known for their expressive communication, using vocalizations and body language to convey their feelings. In Scrum Management, effective communication is vital, with regular ceremonies like Daily Standups and Sprint Reviews facilitating open and transparent communication among team members.

__Adorned with Colors__: Cockatoos boast vibrant and stunning plumage, much like the colorful array of practices and tools in Scrum Management. Scrum ceremonies, artifacts, and roles add richness to the project management process, creating a visually appealing and efficient workflow.
