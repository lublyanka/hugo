IBM SkillsBuild PowerBI program is a certification program offered by IBM in collaboration with Udemy and SkillsBuild. 

The 8-weeks program consists of a series of courses covering various parts of reports in PowerBI: 
1. [Microsoft Power BI - Power BI Desktop Course(24h)](https://udemy.com/course/curso-microsoft-power-bi)
2. [People Analytics with Power BI (5h)](https://udemy.com/course/hr-analytics-con-power-bi-desde-0)
3. [Supply chain (2.5h)](https://udemy.com/course/power-bi-gestion-de-supply-chain-con-business-intelligence)
4. Final Project (20h)


Apart from being a completely new subject for me,  I also faced the additional challenge of taking the course entirely in Spanish as part of the Datahack scholarship program.

## Project Capstone
The last course of a program is a real-world setting project Capstone.
During the project I did many hands-on activities, such as:

* Requirement Gathering and Scoping:
	* Understand the business needs and objectives.
	* Define the scope of the project, including data sources, target audience, and desired outcomes.
* Data Collection and Preparation:
	* Identify relevant data sources (databases, files, etc.).
	* Extract, transform, and load (ETL) the data into Power BI using Power Query.
	* Cleanse and transform the data to make it suitable for analysis.
* Data Modeling:
	* Design the data model by creating relationships between tables.
	* Define calculated columns, measures, and hierarchies.
	* Optimize data model performance.
* Report and Dashboard Design:
	* Create visualizations (charts, tables, maps, etc.) using Power BI Desktop.
	* Arrange visuals on report pages to tell a coherent story.
	* Apply themes, colors, and formatting.
* Report Publishing and Sharing
