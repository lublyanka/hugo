I'm Lu Karelina, 33-years-old **Analyst and Project manager** from Saint-Petersburg, Russia, currently living in MÃ¡laga, Spain. I currently work for <noone>. I enjoy to decompose complex tasks, create a way to deal with problems and make it work. I am a bit of a control freak and looking to increase my skills in devops culture. When I'm not working, you'll probably find me longboarding, reading science fiction or working out.
