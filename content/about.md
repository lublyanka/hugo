I'm Lu Karelina, 29-year-old **QA and Analyst** located in Saint-Petersburg, Russia. I currently work for JSC "Comita". I enjoy to decompose complex tasks, create a way to deal with problems and make it work. I am a bit of a control freak and looking to increase my skills in devops culture. When I'm not working, you'll probably find me longboarding, reading science fiction or working out.
