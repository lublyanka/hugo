I'm Lu Karelina, 34-years-old **Analyst and Project manager** originally from Saint Petersburg, Russia, and nowadays based in MÃ¡laga, Spain. I currently work for <NDA company name>. 
I enjoy decomposing complex tasks, devising effective solutions to problems, and ensuring everything runs smoothly. Some might call me a bit of a control freak, but I see it as a dedication to achieving excellence.
My current passion lies in expanding my expertise in DevOps culture, aiming to streamline processes and enhance efficiency. Outside of work, I find joy in longboarding, diving into science fiction novels, and staying active through workouts.
