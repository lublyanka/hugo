I’m Lua Karelina, a 36-year-old **Delivery and Project manager**, originally from Saint Petersburg, based in sunny Málaga, Spain, and currently working with the team at TradingView.

I specialize decomposing complex tasks, devising effective solutions to problems, and ensuring everything runs smoothly. Some might call me a bit of a control freak or a perfectionist, but I see it as a commitment to building robust, fail-safe systems.

My current passion lies in expanding my expertise in DevOps culture, aiming to streamline processes and enhance efficiency. I bridge the gap between high-level project goals and technical requirements, ensuring that development pipelines are as efficient as the business logic behind them. 

Beyond the Screen, when I’m not optimizing workflows, you’ll find me longboarding along the coast, lost in a Science Fiction novel, or staying active through hiking in nearby mountains.
