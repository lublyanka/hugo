I'm Lu Karelina, 36-years-old **<<Analyst and Project manager>>** originally from Saint Petersburg, Russia, and nowadays based in Málaga, Spain. I currently work for **<<Tradingview ES>>**. 

I enjoy decomposing complex tasks, devising effective solutions to problems, and ensuring everything runs smoothly. Some might call me a bit of a control freak, but I see it as a dedication to achieving excellence.

My current passion lies in expanding my expertise in DevOps culture, aiming to streamline processes and enhance efficiency. Outside of work, I find joy in longboarding, diving into science fiction novels, and staying active through workouts.
